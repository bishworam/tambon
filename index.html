                Over a span of ten years in military service (December 2014 - December 2022), I had the distinct privilege of serving as the personal chauffeur to Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and Duchess. This distinctive role instilled in me the virtues of discipline, teamwork, and unwavering precision.
